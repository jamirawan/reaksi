            <h2>About me</h2>
            <div>
                <p>I'm a digital content producer, front end developer and a freelance website designer focusing on CMS such as Drupal and Wordpress. </p>

<p>I like playing around with some digital stuff like taking photos of anything, making video for fun, do some animation with Adobe Illustrator and After Effecfs or play my electronic music or spinning my DJ controller at home quietly. Spare time is a luxury at the moment since the baby joined the family. </p>

<p>My formal degree is a Bachelor of Science in Biology majoring Marine Ecology but my passion changed to digital world not long after I finished the study. Started making website since 2004 and decided to be a freelance website designer in 2009 for small business in Darwin and still loving it. Beside making website for small businesses and organisations, I also have been working as content producer and webmaster at the seafood industry council, health organisation and latest one at the university.</p>

<p>Although it may sounds like spend all of my life in front of screen or indoor and don't get out off my desk a lot, I do play some sports and like outdoor activities. Living in the tropical of Australia is a perfect outdoor territory as there are not many other things to do indoor. Recently I have been spending my tiny bit of my weekends kayaking around Darwin water. and beautiful Roebuck Bay of Broome.</p>

<p>About that logo: if you google 'wayang Irawan', that where it's from.</p>
